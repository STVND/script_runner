WIP - Intended to give the user a directory(or directories) that they can check for powershell, batch, and bash scripts. It then allows the user to run the scripts using a "script runner".

Todo:
[X]  - Script Running Logic

  [X]  - Pwsh logic

  [X]  - Batch logic
  
  [X]  - Bash logic (Currently only runs Bash in a way that assumes you are using Linux - possibly add OS detection+logic but needs investigation on invoking Git Bash or WSL)
  
[]  - Menus

  [X]  - Main loop prompt
  
  []  - Submenus
  
    []  - List available scripts
    
    []  - List working directories
    
[]  - Config files

  [X]  - Creates initial config
  
  []  - Creates initial script hosting directory
  
  []  - Allows user to list and delist directories
